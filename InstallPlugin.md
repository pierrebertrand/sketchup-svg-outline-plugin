How to install the SketchUp SVG Outline Plugin

If you have an old version installed you may need to delete the FlightsOfIdeas directory in your SketchUp plugins folder. Also delete svgTemplateMakerReg.rb and flightsofideas.rb if they exist.

Your SketchUp plugins should be located somewhere like...
Windows: _C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Google SketchUp 8\Plugins_ or
Mac OS: _Hard Drive/Library/Application Support/Google SketchUp 8/SketchUp/Plugins_

To install the plugin, you want to take the files out of the zip file **sketchup-svg-outlines-plugin-0.99.zip** and put them in your plugins directory. On Windows this is as easy as opening the zip file (double click), selecting all of the files, and them dragging them to your SketchUp plugins directory.

Once you have done this, make sure you have the following files:
  * flightsofideas.rb
  * FlightsOfIdeas - Directory
    * flightsOfIdeasCommon.rb
    * flightsOfIdeasStyle.css
    * flightsOfIdeasTools.rb
    * svgExport.rb
    * svgExportDialog.html
    * svgExportTools.rb
    * svgOkDialog.html
    * Images - Directory
      * Create.png
      * dragonfly\_50.png
      * FlightsOfIdeas.png

Once you have started SketchUp, check that the FlightsOfIdeas extensions are enabled (Window->Preferences->Extensions).

You will then be able to access the right mouse button menu option for exporting SVG.

If the SVG export icon is not on you toolbar, it can be added from the menu (View->Toolbar->FlightsOfIdeas).

The SVG icon should then be dockable to your toolbar.
