This tutorial will specifically present the pipeline from SketchUp -> to -> Inkscape -> to -> Ponoko.

Using Inkscape (or similar) you can edit SVG files and export them to a usable format. For example, an online laser cutting company like Ponoko uses EPS files or you can talk to a local laser cutter about their specific formats.
